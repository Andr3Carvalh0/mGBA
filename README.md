# mGBA

An attempt of a frontend for [mGBA](https://github.com/mgba-emu/mgba) for Android. 

# Building

As of right now, you still cannot play any games with this frontend, since I'm only focus on the UI for now, and I cannot promise that the code is stable or that it builds at all. Still if you are interested in helping all you need to do is clone this repository using the following command:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Andr3Carvalh0/mGBA.git
```
and after that just open the project in Android Studio, and you are done :)
