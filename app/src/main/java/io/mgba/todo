* [MEDIUM] Start handling device state (rotations, change language, etc...)
  (Eg: for now if we rotate the device on the library activity we will fetch the data again for the db, this could be optimized)

        Activity | State
          Intro     Done
          Main      toImplement(Partial)
          Settings  toImplement
          Emulation toImplement

* [MEDIUM] Dispose objects that we dont need.
* [LOW] Add option to customize game controllers.
* [LOW] Move splashActivity logic to a controller.
* [LOW] Start working on the landscape layout.
* [LOW] Reload games when switching directories.
* [MEDIUM] Add so file so we can start using the emulator.
* [LOW] Fix IntroController. It receives a Activity object on CTOR.
        In case of the need to recreate the Activity, there could happen a NullPointException when we came from the worker thread
        For now the only change of it happen is if the user does the following:
            enter app -> init setup -> exits -> changes devices language -> enters app
        For now I'm going to assume that will be a low probably of that happening.
